# Advanced Object Oriented 


1. Getters and Setters for properties

```py
    class Person(object):
        
        def __init__(self,name,age):
            self._name = name
            self._age = age
        
        @property
        def name(self):
            return self._name

        @property
        def age(self):
            return self._age

        @age.setter
        def age(self,age):
            self._age = age
        
        @name.setter
        def age(self,name):
            self._name = name

        
```

2. Use of __slots__ to bind properties - at runtime

```py

class person(object)

    # takes a tuple - unique attributes
    # valid for objects of the class, not subclass
    __slots__ = ('_name', '_age', '_gender')

    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self._name = name
        self._age = age

    @property
    def name(self):
        return self._name
    
    @property
    def age(self):
        return self._age

    @age.property
    def age(self, age):
        self._age = age
    
def main():
    person = Person('haidar', 22)
    person._gender = 'male'
```


3. static methods

```py

from math import sqrt

class Triangle(object):

    def __init__(self, a ,b ,c):
        self._a = a
        self._b = b
        self._c = c
    
    @staticmethod
    def is_valid(a,b,c):
        return a+b>c and b+c>a and a+c>b

    def perimeter(self):
        return self._a +self._b + self._c
    
    def area(self):
        half = self.perimeter()/2
        return sqrt(half * (half- self._a)*(half - self._b)* (half - self._c))
    
    def main():
        a,b,c = 1,2,3
        print(Triangle.is_valid(a,b,c))
        triangle = Triangle(1,2,3)
        print( t.perimeter())
        print(t.area())
```

3. Class methods - methods that produce an object of that class


```py

class Clock(object):

    def __init__(self, hour=0, minute=0, second=0):
        self._hour = hour
        self._minute = minute
        self._second = second

    # Class method - return an instance of the class
    # cls is the constructor method
    @classmethod
    def now(cls):
        currenttime = localtime(time())
        return cls(currenttime.tm_hour, currenttime.tm_min, currenttime.tm_sec)
```


4. Relationship between classes

- 3 Kind of relationships
    - IS-A : - Called inheritance or generalization.
             - between students and people or mobile phone and          electronic product
    
    - HAS-A : - usually called association
              - relationship between department and employee,
              - between car and engine belongs to the relationship
              - if the relationship is integral and partial, then we call it the aggregation relationship; if the whole is further responsible Part of the life cycle (whole and part is inseparable, while at the same time also die), then this is the strongest relationship, we call it a synthetic relationship.
  

    - USE - A 
            -  Called a dependency. 
            -  a driver has a driving behavior (method) in which the     (parameter) is used in a car, and the relationship between the driver and the car is a dependency.

5. Inheritance and Polymorphism
