# Object Oriented Programming

- Classes
    - The __init__ method is the most important method in a class. called when an instance (object) of the class is created
    - All methods - self as their first parameter,Python adds the self argument to the list for you; you do not need to include it when you call the methods. Within a method definition, self refers to the instance calling the method.

```python
    class Cat:
        # Constructor function
        def __init__(self, color, legs):
            # self.attribute - set the initial value of an instance's attributes.
            self.color = color
            self.legs = legs

        def miaow(self):
            print("miaoow")

    felix = Cat("ginger", 4)
    felix.miaow();
    print(felix.fur) # AttributeError. 
```

- Inheritance - share functionality between classes. This similarity can be expressed by making them all inherit from a superclass
    - can be at multiple level 

```python
    class Animal: 
        def __init__(self, name, color):
            self.name = name
            self.color = color

    #Inherits from animal
    class Cat(Animal):
        def purr(self):
            print("Purr...")

    #Inherits from animal
    class Dog(Animal):
        def bark(self):
            print("Woof!")

    fido = Dog("Fido", "brown")
    print(fido.color)
    fido.bark()
```

- Overiding methods - If a class inherits from another with the same attributes or methods, it overrides them.

```python
    class Wolf: 
    def __init__(self, name, color):
        self.name = name
        self.color = color
        def bark(self):
            print("Grr...")

    class Dog(Wolf):
        # Overiding bark
        def bark(self):
            print("Woof")
            super().bark() # access superclass method
        
    husky = Dog("Max", "grey")
    husky.bark() # woof Grr..
```


- Magic Methods & Operator Overloading - Magic methods are special methods which have double underscores at the beginning and end of their names. 
    - 'dunders' e.g __ init __
    - create functionality that can't be represented as a normal method. 
    - operator overloading -  operators for custom classes that allow operators such as + and * to be used on them.

``` python
    #Magic operator for __add__ is +
    class Vector2D:
        def __init__(self, x, y):
            self.x = x
            self.y = y

        def __add__(self, other):
            return Vector2D(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)

        first = Vector2D(5, 7)
        second = Vector2D(3, 9)
        result = first + second # __add__ is called
  -      print(result.x)
        print(result.y)
```

  - More magic methods for common operators:
    - __ sub__ for -
    - __ mul__ for *
    - __ truediv__ for /
    - __ floordiv__ for //
    - __ mod__ for %
    - __ pow__ for **
    - __ and__ for &
    - __ xor__ for ^
    - __ or__ for |
    - __ lt__ for <
    - __ le__ for <=
    - __ eq__ for ==
    - __ ne__ for != #If __ne__ is not implemented, it returns the opposite of __ eq__. 
    - __ gt__ for >
    - __ ge__ for >=

```python
    class SpecialString:
        def __init__(self, cont):
            self.cont = cont

        def __truediv__(self, other):
            line = "=" * len(other.cont)
            return "\n".join([self.cont, line, other.cont])

        spam = SpecialString("spam")
        hello = SpecialString("Hello world!")
        print(spam / hello)

    class SpecialString:
        def __init__(self, cont):
            self.cont = cont

        def __gt__(self, other):
            for index in range(len(other.cont)+1):
                result = other.cont[:index] + ">" + self.cont
                result += ">" + other.cont[index:]
                print(result)

        spam = SpecialString("spam")
        eggs = SpecialString("eggs")
        spam > eggs

        # >spam>eggs
        # e>spam>ggs
        # eg>spam>gs
        # egg>spam>s
        # eggs>spam>
```

- There are several magic methods for making classes act like containers.
 - __ len__ for len()
 - __ getitem__ for indexing
 - __ setitem__ for assigning to indexed values
 - __ delitem__ for deleting indexed values
 - __ iter__ for iteration over objects (e.g., in for loops)
- __ contains__ for in


```python
    import random

    class VagueList:
    def __init__(self, cont):
        self.cont = cont

    def __getitem__(self, index):
        return self.cont[index + random.randint(-1, 1)]

    def __len__(self):
        return random.randint(0, len(self.cont)*2)

    vague_list = VagueList(["A", "B", "C", "D", "E"])
    print(len(vague_list))
    print(len(vague_list))
    print(vague_list[2])

```

----------
## Object Lifecycle

- The lifecycle of an object is made up of its creation, manipulation, and destruction.
    - The first stage of the life-cycle of an object is the definition of the class to which it belongs.
    - The next stage is the instantiation of an instance, when __ init__ is called. Memory is allocated to store the instance.
    - Just before this occurs, the __ new__ method of the class is called. This is usually overridden only in special cases.
    - Eventually, it will finish being used, and can be destroyed.Destruction of an object occurs when its reference count reaches zero.
    - The magic method for the del statement is __ del__. -> garbage collection.

```python
    a = 42  # Create object <42>
    b = a  # Increase ref. count  of <42> 
    c = [a]  # Increase ref. count  of <42> 

    del a  # Decrease ref. count  of <42>
    b = 100  # Decrease ref. count  of <42> 
    c[0] = -1  # Decrease ref. count  of <42>
```

## Data hiding- use of private and public in python - no ways of enforcing a method or attribute be strictly private. 

- Weakly private methods and attributes have a single underscore at the beginning.
- Its only actual effect is that from module_name import * won't import variables that start with a single underscore.

```python
    class Queue:
        def __init__(self, contents):
            self._hiddenlist = list(contents) # start by underscore

        def push(self, value):
            self._hiddenlist.insert(0, value)
        
        def pop(self):
            return self._hiddenlist.pop(-1)

        def __repr__(self):
            return "Queue({})".format(self._hiddenlist)

            queue = Queue([1, 2, 3])
            print(queue)
            queue.push(0)
            print(queue)
            queue.pop()
            print(queue)
            print(queue._hiddenlist) # can still use it 
```

- Strongly private methods and attributes have a double underscore
-  The method __ privatemethod of class Spam could be accessed externally with _Spam__privatemethod.

```python
    class Spam:
        __egg = 7
        def print_egg(self):
            print(self.__egg)

        s = Spam()
        s.print_egg() # 7
        print(s._Spam__egg)  # 7
        print(s.__egg) # AttributeError: 'Spam' object has no attribute '__egg'
```

## Class method

- Methods of objects - self passed as parameter of the method
- Class methods- they are called by a class, which is passed to the cls parameter of the method. 
- factory methods 
- Class methods are marked with a classmethod decorator.

```python
    class Rectangle:
        def __init__(self, width, height):
            self.width = width
            self.height = height

        def calculate_area(self):
            return self.width * self.height


        @classmethod
        def new_square(cls, side_length):
            return cls(side_length, side_length)

        square = Rectangle.new_square(5)
        print(square.calculate_area())
```
- new_square is a class method and is called on the class, rather than on an instance of the class. It returns a new object of the class cls.

## Static method
 - Similar to class methods, except they don't receive any additional arguments; they are identical to normal functions that belong to a class. 
- They are marked with the staticmethod decorator.

```python
    class Pizza:
        def __init__(self, toppings):
            self.toppings = toppings

        @staticmethod
        def validate_topping(topping):
            if topping == "pineapple":
                raise ValueError("No pineapples!")
            else:
                return True

        ingredients = ["cheese", "onions", "spam"]
        if all(Pizza.validate_topping(i) for i in ingredients):
            pizza = Pizza(ingredients) 
```

## Properties
 - provide a way of customizing access to instance attributes. 
 - property decorator above a method
 - which means when the instance attribute with the same name as the method is accessed, the method will be called instead. 
 - readonly

```python
    class Pizza:
        def __init__(self, toppings):
            self.toppings = toppings
            
        @property
        def pineapple_allowed(self):
            return False

        pizza = Pizza(["cheese", "tomato"])
        print(pizza.pineapple_allowed) False
        pizza.pineapple_allowed = True # AttributeError: can't set attribute
```
- Getters and setters

```python
    class Pizza:
        def __init__(self, toppings):
            self.toppings = toppings
            self._pineapple_allowed = False

        #Getter
        @property
        def pineapple_allowed(self):
            return self._pineapple_allowed

        #Setter
        @pineapple_allowed.setter
        def pineapple_allowed(self, value):
            if value:
            password = input("Enter the password: ")
            if password == "Sw0rdf1sh!":
                self._pineapple_allowed = value
            else:
                raise ValueError("Alert! Intruder!")

        pizza = Pizza(["cheese", "tomato"])
        print(pizza.pineapple_allowed)
        pizza.pineapple_allowed = True
        print(pizza.pineapple_allowed)

```

A Simple Game

```python
    # Using procedural programming
    def get_input():
        command = input(": ").split()
        verb_word = command[0]
        if verb_word in verb_dict:
            verb = verb_dict[verb_word]
        else:
            print("Unknown verb {}". format(verb_word))
            return

        if len(command) >= 2:
            noun_word = command[1]
            print (verb(noun_word))
        else:
            print(verb("nothing"))

        def say(noun):
        return 'You said "{}"'.format(noun)

        verb_dict = {
        "say": say,
        }

        while True:
        get_input()
```

Using objects to store game obj

```python
class GameObject:
  class_name = ""
  desc = ""
  objects = {}

  def __init__(self, name):
    self.name = name
    GameObject.objects[self.class_name] = self

  def get_desc(self):
    return self.class_name + "\n" + self.desc

class Goblin(GameObject):
    class_name = "goblin"
    desc = "A foul creature"

    goblin = Goblin("Gobbly")

    def examine(noun):
    if noun in GameObject.objects:
        return GameObject.objects[noun].get_desc()
    else:
        return "There is no {} here.".format(noun)

```

We created a Goblin class, which inherits from the GameObjects class.
We also created a new function examine, which returns the objects description.
Now we can add a new "examine" verb to our dictionary and try it out!

```python
    verb_dict = {
    "say": say,
    "examine": examine,
    }
```

Adding more properties and methods to goblin

``` python
    class Goblin(GameObject):
        def __init__(self, name):
            self.class_name = "goblin"
            self.health = 3
            self._desc = " A foul creature"
            super().__init__(name)

        @property
        def desc(self):
            if self.health >=3:
                return self._desc
            elif self.health == 2:
                health_line = "It has a wound on its knee."
            elif self.health == 1:
                health_line = "Its left arm has been cut off!"
            elif self.health <= 0:
                health_line = "It is dead."
            return self._desc + "\n" + health_line

        @desc.setter
        def desc(self, value):
            self._desc = value

        def hit(noun):
        if noun in GameObject.objects:
            thing = GameObject.objects[noun]
            if type(thing) == Goblin:
                thing.health = thing.health - 1
            if thing.health <= 0:
                msg = "You killed the goblin!"
            else: 
                msg = "You hit the {}".format(thing.class_name)
        else:
            msg ="There is no {} here.".format(noun) 
        return msg

```
