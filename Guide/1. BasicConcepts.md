# Python Programming

## 1. Basics

Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. There is no need to compile your program before executing it

The three major versions of Python are 1.x, 2.x and 3.x. These are subdivided into minor versions, such as 2.7 and 3.3.

Code written for Python 3.x is guaranteed to work in all future versions. 

Python has several different implementations, written in various languages. The version used in this course, CPython

## 2. Coding 
- Printing 
```python
    print('Hello world!') 
     >> Hello world
```
- Number operations
- 
```python
     #exponentiation
     2**5 -> 2^5
     >>32

     #Quotient & Remainder
     20 // 6
     >>3
     1.25 % 0.5
     >>0.25


```

- String

use backslash '\' for escape characters

```python
    # to use apostrophe use a backslash
    'Brian\'s mother:'

    #new line
    '\n'

    print('hello \n world')
    >> hello 
       world
```

- Input

```python
     input("Enter something please: ")
     Enter something please: This is what\nthe user enters!

    'This is what\\nthe user enters!'
    #input is escaped automatically by python
```

- Type conversion

```python
    "2" + "3"
    >> '23'
    
    int("2") + int("3")
    >> 5

    float(input("Enter a number: ")) + float(input("Enter another number: "))
    Enter a number: 40
    Enter another number: 2
    >> 42.0
```

- Variables

```python   
   foo = "a string"
   del foo # clearing the reference to foo

    foo = input("Enter a number: ")
    Enter a number: 7
    print(foo)
    >> 7

    x = 2
    x += 3
    print (x) #5 
```
