# More Types

- None- The None object is used to represent the absence of a value. It is similar to null in other programming languages. 

```python
    #The None object is returned by any function that doesn't explicitly return anything else.

    def some_func():
        print("Hi!")

    var = some_func()
    print(var)
```

- Dictionnaries

Dictionaries are data structures used to map arbitrary keys to values. {key:value} pair

```python
    ages = {"Dave": 24, "Mary": 42, "John": 58}
    print(ages["Dave"]) # 24

    primary = {
    "red": [255, 0, 0], 
    "green": [0, 255, 0], 
    "blue": [0, 0, 255], 
    }

    print(primary["red"])
    print(primary["yellow"]) #KeyError: 'yellow'

    squares = {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: "error", 4: 16,}
    squares[8] = 64

```
Only immutable objects can be used as **keys** to dictionaries

### whether key in dictionnary

```python
    nums = {
        1: "one",
        2: "two",
        3: "three",
        }
    print(1 in nums) #True
    print("three" in nums) #False

    pairs = {1: "apple",
        "orange": [2, 3, 4], 
        True: False, 
        None: "True",
    }

    print(pairs.get("orange")) # [2,3,4]
    print(pairs.get(7)) #None
    print(pairs.get(12345, "not in dictionary")) # not in dictionnary
```

- Tuples -Tuples are very similar to lists, except that they are immutable

```python
    words = ("spam", "eggs", "sausages",)
    my_tuple = "one", "two", "three"

    print(words[0])
    words[1] = "cheese" #typeError - cannot be changes
```

- List Slices

```python

    squares = [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
    print(squares[2:6]) #[4, 9, 16, 25]
    print(squares[3:8]) #[9, 16, 25, 36, 49]
    print(squares[0:1]) # [0]

    squares = [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
    print(squares[::2]) # [0, 4, 16, 36, 64] -As from 2nd index
    print(squares[2:8:3]) # [4, 25] - alternate values

    #negative index - count from end of list
    squares = [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
    print(squares[1:-1]) # [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64]

```

-  List Comprehensions

```python
    # a list comprehension
    cubes = [i**3 for i in range(5)]
    print(cubes) # [0, 1, 8, 27, 64]

    evens=[i**2 for i in range(10) if i**2 % 2 == 0]
    print(evens) #[0, 4, 16, 36, 64]

    even = [2*i for i in range(10**100)] #memory error
```


- String formatting

```python
    # string formatting
    nums = [4, 5, 6]
    msg = "Numbers: {0} {1} {2}". format(nums[0], nums[1], nums[2])
    print(msg) #Numbers: 4 5 6

    # with named arguments
    a = "{x}, {y}".format(x=5, y=12)
    print(a)
```

- String functions

  - join - joins a list of strings with another string as a separator. 
  - replace - replaces one substring in a string with another.
  - startswith and endswith - determine if there is a substring at the start and end of a string, respectively. 
  - To change the case of a string, you can use lower and upper.
  - split is the opposite of join, turning a string with a certain separator into a list.


```python
    print(", ".join(["spam", "eggs", "ham"]))
    #prints "spam, eggs, ham"

    print("Hello ME".replace("ME", "world"))
    #prints "Hello world"

    print("This is a sentence.".startswith("This"))
    # prints "True"

    print("This is a sentence.".endswith("sentence."))
    # prints "True"

    print("This is a sentence.".upper())
    # prints "THIS IS A SENTENCE."

    print("AN ALL CAPS SENTENCE".lower())
    #prints "an all caps sentence"

    print("spam, eggs, ham".split(", "))
    #prints "['spam', 'eggs', 'ham']"
```

- Text Analyser

```python
    def count_char(text, char):
    count = 0
    for c in text:
        if c == char:
        count += 1
    return count

    filename = input("Enter a filename: ")
    with open(filename) as f:
    text = f.read()
    print(count_char(text, "r"))

    for char in "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz":
        perc = 100 * count_char(text, char) / len(text)
        print("{0} - {1}%".format(char, round(perc, 2)))

```
