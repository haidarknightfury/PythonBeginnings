# Zen of python


```python
    # import to use the zen of python
    import this

```

- Function arguments -  Python allows to have function with varying number of arguments. using *args

```python
#an arbitrary number of arguments to that function. 
   def function(named_arg, *args):
        print(named_arg) #1
        print(args) # (2,3,4,5) # *args is a tupple

    function(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
```

- Default Values - Named parameters to a function can be made optional by giving them a default value. 
```python
    def function(x, y, food="spam"):
        print(food)

    function(1, 2) #spam
    function(3, 4, "egg") #egg
```

- **kwargs (standing for keyword arguments) allows you to handle named arguments that you have not defined in advance.
    - The keyword arguments return a dictionary in which the keys are the argument names, and the values are the argument values.    

```python

    def my_func(x, y=7, *args, **kwargs):
        print(kwargs) #{'a': 7, 'b': 8}

    my_func(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, a=7, b=8)

```

- Tuple Unpacking -allows you to assign each item in an iterable (often a tuple) to a variable.

```python
    numbers = (1, 2, 3)
    a, b, c = numbers
    print(a) #1
    print(b) #2
    print(c) #3

    x, y = [1, 2]
    x, y = y, x #y = 1

    a, b, *c, d = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
    print(a)
    print(b)
    print(c) # [3 4 5 6 7 8]
    print(d)
```

- Ternary Operator - if statements while using less code. 

```python
    a = 7
    b = 1 if a >= 5 else 42
    print(b) #1

    status  = 1
    msg = "Logout" if status == 1 else "Login"
```

- else with a for or while loop - else part is called when the loop finishes normally without a break - notice level of else

```python
    for i in range(10):
        if i == 999:
            break
    else:
        print("Unbroken 1") #unbroken 1

    for i in range(10):
        if i == 5:
            break
    else: 
    print("Unbroken 2") # do not execute as break

```

- else  with try/except statements. - execute when  no errors in try
```python
    try:
        print(1)
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print(2)
    else:
        print(3) #3 no error in try

    try:
        print(1/0)
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print(4) # 4 - zero division
    else:
        print(5) # do not print else as error
```

- __ main __ -  sometimes it is useful to make a file that can be both imported as a module and run as a script. 
To do this, place script code inside if __ name__ == "__main __". 


```python
    def function():
        print("This is a module function")

    if __name__=="__main__":
        print("This is a script")
        # script code inside 

```
 if the Python interpreter is running that module (the source file) as the main program, it sets the special __ name__ variable to have a value "__main __". If this file is being imported from another module, __name __ will be set to the module's name.


```python 
    #sololearn.py
    def function():
        print("This is a module function")

    # execute only if it is the script file itself
    if __name__=="__main__":
        print("This is a script") 
```

```python 
    #some_script.py
    import sololearn

    sololearn.function()
```

```python
#Rearrange the code to print "Welcome" if the script is imported, and "Hi" if it is not imported.

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        print ("hi")
    else:
        print "welcome"

```

-  Major 3rd-Party Libraries

   - Django: The most frequently used web framework written in Python, Django powers websites that include Instagram and Disqus. 
   - CherryPy and Flask are also popular web frameworks.
   - For scraping data from websites, the library BeautifulSoup is very useful, and leads to better results than building your own scraper with regular expressions.


- matplotlib allows you to create graphs based on data in Python. 
-  NumPy allows for the use of multidimensional arrays that are much faster 
    -   It also contains functions to perform mathematical operations such as matrix transformations on the arrays. 
-  SciPy contains numerous extensions to the functionality of NumPy.

- game development. 
    - Usually, it is used as a scripting language for games written in other languages, but it can be used to make games by itself. 
    - For 3D games, the library Panda3D can be used. For 2D games, you can use pygame.

----------

- Packaging - refers to putting modules you have written in a standard format, so that other programmers can install and use them with ease. 
    -  use of the modules setuptools and distutils.

```python
    SoloLearn/
   LICENSE.txt
   README.txt
   setup.py #important
   sololearn/
      __init__.py #important
      sololearn.py
      sololearn2.py

``` 

- Setup.py - information necessary to assemble the package so it can be uploaded to PyPI and installed with pip (name, version, etc.).

```python
    from distutils.core import setup

setup(
   name='SoloLearn', 
   version='0.1dev',
   packages=['sololearn',],
   license='MIT', 
   long_description=open('README.txt').read(),
)
```

-  After creating the setup.py file, upload it to PyPI, or use the command line to create a binary distribution (an executable installer).
-  to build a source distribution, use the command line to navigate to the directory containing setup.py, and run the command python setup.py sdist.
-  Run python setup.py bdist or, for Windows, python setup.py bdist_wininst to build a binary distribution. 
- Use python setup.py register, followed by python setup.py sdist upload to upload a package.
- Finally, install a package with python setup.py install.

----------

py2exe, can be used to package a Python script, along with the libraries it requires, into a single executable to run on windows without needing python installed. PyInstaller and cx_Freeze serve the same purpose.For Macs, use py2app, PyInstaller or cx_Freeze
