# Functional Programming

- Example
```python
    def apply_twice(func, arg):
   return func(func(arg))

    def add_five(x):
    return x + 5

    print(apply_twice(add_five, 10))
```

- Pure Functions - Pure functions have no side effects, and return a value that depends only on their arguments.
    - Functional programming use pure functions 

```python
    #state of vars do not change -> pure
    def pure_function(x, y):
        temp = x + 2*y
        return temp / (2*x + y)
    
    # Impure - bc change the state of the list
    some_list = []
    def impure(arg):
    some_list.append(arg)
```

- Map - The built-in functions map and filter are very useful higher-order functions that operate on lists (or similar objects called iterables). 

```python
    def add_five(x):
        return x + 5

    nums = [11, 22, 33, 44, 55]
    result = list(map(add_five, nums))
    print(result) #[16, 27, 38, 49, 60]
```

- Filter -The function filter filters an iterable by removing items that don't match a predicate (a function that returns a Boolean). 

```python
    nums = [11, 22, 33, 44, 55]
    res = list(filter(lambda x: x%2==0, nums))
    print(res)
```

- Generators are a type of iterable, like lists or tuples.  Unlike lists, they don't allow indexing with arbitrary indices, but they can still be iterated through with for loops. 

```python
    def countdown():
    i=5
    while i > 0:
        yield i
        i -= 1
    
    for i in countdown():
    print(i)  
    # 5 4 3 2 1

    # The yield statement is used to define a generator, replacing the return of a function to provide a result to its caller without destroying local variables.
```

- Decorators provide a way to modify functions using other functions.  This is ideal when you need to extend the functionality of functions that you don't want to modify.

```python
    def decor(func):
        def wrap():
            print("============")
            func()
            print("============")
        return wrap

    def print_text():
    print("Hello world!")

    decorated = decor(print_text)
    decorated()
```
We defined a function named decor that has a single parameter func. Inside decor, we defined a nested function named wrap. The wrap function will print a string, then call func(), and print another string. The decor function returns the wrap function as its result.
We could say that the variable decorated is a decorated version of print_text - it's print_text plus something. 
In fact, if we wrote a useful decorator we might want to replace print_text with the decorated version altogether so we always got our "plus something" version of print_text. 
This is done by re-assigning the variable that contains our function:

```python
    print_text = decor(print_text)
    print_text()
```

- Recursion

```python
    def factorial(x):
    if x == 1:
        return 1
    else: 
        return x * factorial(x-1)
    
    print(factorial(5))

    # INDIRECT RECURSION
    def is_even(x):
        if x == 0:
            return True
        else:
            return is_odd(x-1)

    def is_odd(x):
        return not is_even(x)

    print(is_odd(17))
    print(is_even(23))

    #One function can call a second, which calls the first, which calls the second, and so on. This can occur with any number of functions.
```

- Sets

```python
    num_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    word_set = set(["spam", "eggs", "sausage"])

    print(3 in num_set)
    print("spam" not in word_set)

    nums = {1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4, 5, 6}
    print(nums)
    nums.add(-7) #instead of append for list
    nums.remove(3) # remove item
    print(nums)

    # Cannot contain duplicates

```


Sets can be combined using mathematical operations.

- union - |
- intersection - &
- difference  -
- symmetric  ^ gets items in either set, but not both.
```python
    first = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
    second = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

    print(first | second) #{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
    print(first & second) #{4, 5, 6}
    print(first - second) # {1,2,3}
    print(second - first) #{8, 9, 7}
    print(first ^ second) #{1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9}
```

- Itertools -  a standard library that contains several functions that are useful in functional programming. 

  - The function count counts up infinitely from a value. 
  - The function cycle infinitely iterates through an iterable (for instance a list or string). 
  - The function repeat repeats an object, either infinitely or a specific number of times.
  - takewhile - takes items from an iterable while a predicate function remains true;
  - chain - combines several iterables into one long one; 
  - accumulate - returns a running total of values in an iterable.

 ```python

    from itertools import count

    for i in count(3):
    print(i)
    if i >=11:
        break

    from itertools import accumulate, takewhile

    nums = list(accumulate(range(8)))
    print(nums) # [0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28]
    print(list(takewhile(lambda x: x<= 6, nums)))# [0, 1, 3, 6]
 ``` 

 ```python
    from itertools import accumulate, takewhile

    nums = list(accumulate(range(8)))
    print(nums) # [0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28]
    print(list(takewhile(lambda x: x<= 6, nums)))# [0, 1, 3, 6]

    from itertools import product, permutations

    letters = ("A", "B")
    print(list(product(letters, range(2)))) #[('A', 0), ('A', 1), ('B', 0), ('B', 1)]
    print(list(permutations(letters))) #[('A', 'B'), ('B', 'A')]
 ``` 

 - Lambda - Functions created this way are known as anonymous.

```python
    def my_func(f, arg):
        return f(arg)

    my_func(lambda x: 2*x*x, 5)

    #named function
    def polynomial(x):
        return x**2 + 5*x + 4
    print(polynomial(-4))
    #lambda
    print((lambda x: x**2 + 5*x + 4) (-4))

    #lambda to assign to variable
    double = lambda x: x * 2
    print(double(7))
```
