# Exceptions And Files

- ZeroDivisionError exception by trying to divide 7 by 0.
- Different exceptions are raised for different reasons. 
- Common exceptions:
  - ImportError: an import fails;
  - IndexError: a list is indexed with an out-of-range number;
  - NameError: an unknown variable is used;
  - SyntaxError: the code can't be parsed properly;
  - TypeError: a function is called on a value of an inappropriate type;
  - ValueError: a function is called on a value of the correct type, but with an inappropriate value.


- Exception Handling

```python
    try:
        num1 = 7
        num2 = 0
        print (num1 / num2)
        print("Done calculation")
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("An error occurred")
        print("due to zero division")


    try:
        variable = 10
        print(variable + "hello")
        print(variable / 2)
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Divided by zero")
    except (ValueError, TypeError): #Multiple exception in parentheses
        print("Error occurred")

    try:
        word = "spam"
        print(word / 0)
    except: #except w/o exception - catch all exceptions
        print("An error occurred")
```

- Finally

```python
    try:
        print("Hello")
        print(1 / 0)
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Divided by zero")
    finally:
        print("This code will run no matter what") 


    try:
        print(1)
        print(10 / 0)
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print(unknown_var)
    finally:
    print("This is executed last") # will execute if there is uncaught exception in preceding block
```

- Raising Exception

```python

    print(1)
    raise ValueError # Raising an exception
    print(2)

    try:
       num = 5 / 0
    except:
        print("An error occurred")
        raise #re raise exception

    print(1)
    assert 2 + 2 == 4
    print(2)
    assert 1 + 1 == 3 #Assertion error
    print(3)

    temp = -10
    assert (temp >= 0), "Colder than absolute zero!"
    # AssertionError: Colder than absolute zero! - argument passed to assertion error

## Files

- Opening files

```python
    myfile = open("filename.txt") #Opening a file

    # write mode
    open("filename.txt", "w")

    # read mode
    open("filename.txt", "r")
    open("filename.txt")

    # binary write mode - binary non text file: img and sound
    open("filename.txt", "wb")


    file = open("filename.txt", "w")
    # do stuff to the file
    file.close()
```

- Reading files
```python
    myfile = open("filename.txt","r") #Opening a file
    cont = file.read()# read all content to cont
    print(cont)
    file.close()

    file = open("filename.txt", "r")
    print(file.read(16)) # read 16 bytes
    print(file.read()) # read rest of file
    file.close()
```

- Read line

```python

    # read first line
    file = open("filename.txt", "r")
    print(file.readlines()) # read line in a file
    file.close()

    # Read all lines
    file = open("filename.txt", "r")
    for line in file:
        print(line)

    file.close() 
```


- Write to file

```python
    file = open("newfile.txt", "w")
    file.write("This has been written to a file")
    file.close()

    file = open("newfile.txt", "r")
    print(file.read()) #This has been written to a file
    file.close()


    msg = "Hello world!"
    file = open("newfile.txt", "w")
    amount_written = file.write(msg) # return number of bytes written
    print(amount_written)
    file.close()
```
**#When a file is opened in write mode, the file's existing content is deleted.**


- Working with files

```python
    try:
        f = open("filename.txt")
        print(f.read())
    finally:
         f.close()
    #This ensures that the file is always closed, even if an error occurs.
```

```python
    # using with to open file , f only assessible in block as temporary variable
    with open("filename.txt") as f:
    print(f.read())
```
